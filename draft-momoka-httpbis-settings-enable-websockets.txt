Abstract

   This document proposes the addition of a new HTTP settings parameter,
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS, which would be sent by the server to the
   client in the HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 handshake response.  This parameter
   would indicate whether the server supports WebSockets over HTTP/2 or
   HTTP/3 on the established connection.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS
   parameter would allow the client to determine in advance whether the
   server supports WebSockets over the connection, allowing it to avoid
   sending unnecessary WebSocket handshake requests on HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
   connections that do not support bootstrapping WebSockets.

1.  Introduction

   The mechanisms for running the WebSocket protocol over a single
   stream of an HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connection are defined in [RFC8441]
   and [RFC9220].  For bootstrapping WebSockets from HTTP/2 and HTTP/3,
   the extended CONNECT mechanism is used.  Support for the extended
   CONNECT is advertised using HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 settings
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL.  However, the support of extended
   CONNECT does not necessarily indicate support for WebSockets over
   that HTTP connection.  Other protocols such as
   [I-D.draft-ietf-webtrans-overview] also use extended CONNECT and will
   be sending SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL settings parameters as
   well.

   If the server sends SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL because it
   supports extended CONNECT but not bootstrapping WebSockets over that
   HTTP connection, the client sending a WebSocket handshake request
   will result in a 501 response and falling back to HTTP/1 will be
   needed.

2.  SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS settigs parameter for h2 nad h3

   This document proposes the addition of a new HTTP settings parameter,
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS, which would be included in the SETTINGS
   frame of the HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 handshake response.  If the server
   supports WebSockets over the HTTP connection, it would include the
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS parameter in the SETTINGS frame with a
   value of 1.  If the server does not support WebSockets over HTTP/2 or
   HTTP/3, it would not include the parameter in the SETTINGS frame or
   send it with a value of 0.

   The SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS parameter would allow the client to
   determine in advance whether the server supports WebSockets over the
   connection for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, allowing it to avoid sending
   unnecessary WebSocket handshake requests on HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
   connections that do not support WebSockets.  This would improve the
   performance and efficiency of WebSocket connections over HTTP/2 and
   HTTP/3, as well as providing better compatibility with servers that
   support WebSockets over HTTP/1 or HTTP/2 but not HTTP/3.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8441] and [RFC9220].
