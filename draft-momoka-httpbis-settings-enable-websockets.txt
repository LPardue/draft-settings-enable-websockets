  SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS settings parameter for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
         draft-momoka-httpbis-settings-enable-websockets-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a new HTTP settings parameter,
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS.  This parameter indicates whether the
   server supports bootstrapping WebSockets over the established
   connection.

1.  Introduction

   The mechanisms for running the WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] over a
   single stream of an HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connection is defined in
   [RFC8441] and [RFC9220].  The extended CONNECT mechanism is used for
   bootstrapping WebSockets from HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.  Support for the
   extended CONNECT is advertised using HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 settings
   parameter SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL.  However, the support of
   extended CONNECT does not necessarily indicate support for WebSockets
   over that HTTP connection.  Other protocols such as [WEBTRANSPORT]
   also use extended CONNECT and send SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL
   settings parameters as well.

   Suppose the server supports extended CONNECT but not bootstrapping
   WebSockets over that HTTP connection.  In this case, the client
   sending a WebSocket handshake request will result in a response of
   501 (Not Implemented) status code (Section 15.6.2 of [HTTP]), and the
   client would need to fall back to trying the WebSocket handshake over
   HTTP/1.

   This is why a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS settings parameter is
   needed.

2.  SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS settigs parameter for H2 and H3

   This document adds a new SETTINGS parameter to those defined by
   [HTTP/3] Section 11.2.2 and [HTTP/2] Section 11.3.

   The new parameter name is SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS.  The value of
   the parameter MUST be 0 or 1.

   A sender MUST NOT send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS parameter with
   the value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1.

   If the server supports bootstrapping WebSockets over the HTTP
   connection, it would include the SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS parameter
   in the SETTINGS frame with a value of 1.  If the server does not
   support WebSockets over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, it will not have the
   parameter in the SETTINGS frame or send it with a value of 0.

   A client MUST not send this setting parameter.  Receipt of this
   parameter by a server does not have any impact.

   The SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS parameter would allow the client to
   determine in advance whether the server supports WebSockets over the
   connection for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, allowing the client to avoid sending
   unnecessary WebSocket handshake requests on HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
   connections that do not support WebSockets.

   This will improve compatibility with other extended CONNECT-based
   protocols.

   For compatibility with past implementations which do not use this
   parameter, clients MAY initiate a WebSocket request without the
   receipt of this parameter.

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8441].
